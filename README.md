# Semar-App
The Semar application is developed to introduce and preserve the cultural heritage of Wayang Kulit to the community, 
especially the younger generation. This application provides information about Wayang Kulit characters, such as their names, 
images, and historical stories. Additionally, the application offers convenience to users who wish to watch Wayang Kulit performances,
both online through the application and offline by providing a ticket purchasing feature for the shows.
